Code repository for my dissertation : " Investigating melody complexity in polyphonic-music" 


This study aims to assess the complexity of melody extracted by two state-of-art algorithms through a computational pipeline that iteratively removes 
the maximally correlated track with the melody extracted by the algorithm. This pipeline was tested on two algorithms, 
one based merely on signal processing while the latter based on signal processing and deep learning.


Behavioural analysis: Code for the behavioural analysis website, the data acquired from this anlaysis and the plots

Computational analysis: Code for the evaluation pipeline for both algorithms, the data acquired for the correlations and the melody complexity plots
